  Technologies Used: CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, Deck of Cards API, and HTML5

  This was one of my early projects at Full Sail where we were tasked with the simple challenge of implementing any API we could find. I decided to create a simple blackjack game with the Deck of Cards API. The reason I choose to include this was because it was when I first realized how much I love working with Javascript and APIs. It really helped me figure out what I wanted to be doing in Web. You can see it live [here](https://spencerlee200.github.io/blackjack/).
